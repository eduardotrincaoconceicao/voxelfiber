## Overview

voxelfiber is a morphological simulator for porous materials that can be modeled as planar random networks. Typical examples include paper sheets and electrospun webs. Fibers are represented by a chain of voxels in a 3D discrete spatial grid. This has the added benefit of allowing the direct use of methods developed for the 3D imaging field. The key property of fiber flexibility is implemented via the [mechanism](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.73.3475) originally proposed for the [KCL](http://kcl.fi)-PAKKA simulator.

## Installation

voxelfiber requires MATLAB R2021a and above. It also requires the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox. For the time being voxelfiber will not be packaged in a toolbox. Simply download the source code and documentation to a convenient folder.

Run the demo by typing `formingdemo` in the MATLAB command window.

## Getting started

The function `forming()` is used to construct the virtual material object and method functions are applied to the object to compute morphology features:

- porosity, by function `porosity()`
- sheet thickness, by function `thickness()`
- relative bonded area, by function `rba()`
- number of contacts between fibers, by function `numcrossings()`
- number of fibers covering a point, by function `coverage()`

3D visualization is done using function `vis_sheet()`. This can take several minutes for large sheets with high basis weight. Help documentation is available in the form of live scripts found under the folder _help_.

## More resources

A basic description of voxelfiber can be found in [Coding a Simulation Model of the 3D Structure of Paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-12712-0_27). Please cite this paper if you use voxelfiber.
